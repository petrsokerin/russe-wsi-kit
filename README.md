# russe-wsi-kit

Repo for solution of competition [russe-wsi-kit](https://russe.nlpub.org/2018/wsi/) as a task for Homework of Statistical Natural Language Processing course @ Skoltech '21.

## Idea

The goal of competition is to provide an algorithms for Word Sense Induction (WSI) with generating embeddings of contexts of different ammonims and providing clustering on the embeddings. 

## Repository contents

| File or Folder | Content |
| --- | --- |
| russe-wsi-kit | original repo with data and benchmarks|
| Assignment_template_v10.ipynb | jupyter notebook contains solution and used model describtions|
| math_lectures.model | weights for one of the models|
| active_res.png, wiki_res.png, btc_res.png | pictures for importing in jupyter notebook |

## Results

For all datasets vectorizer Word2vec2 help to achieve the best results for most clustering algorithms. However, for different datasets diffeferent clustering algorithms show the best results. More details you can see in jupyter notebook.
